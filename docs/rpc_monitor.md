# RPC Monitor

While the [status page](https://status.notional.ventures/) can be used for service healthy from external view, 
it doesnt not give details in case like 50% tasks down of a service. In that case, the service still looks
healthy externally, but its not.

With this tool, we can see healthy status of every taksk of every rpc service in the cluster.
