### Steps

1. At the upgrading block, chain stops synching. And `rpc_monitor` marks it with `yellow` or `red` color.

    Its `rpc_chihuahua_68` in this example
   

2. Next, we need to figure out which swarm node running the rpc service by running this command in a swarm manager node:
    
    ```console
    docker service ps rpc_chihuahua_68
    ```

    Its in `cosmosia17` node in this example.
   

3. Then get into `cosmosia17` console and run this command to figure out which container running the rpc service:

    ```console
    docker ps -a |grep rpc_chihuahua_68
    ```

    Its `3089677a62f6` in this example.
   

4. Now, get into the container console by running this command on `cosmosia17` node:

    ```console
    docker exec -it 3089677a62f6 /bin/bash
    ```

5. Check the log of the chain to confirm there's an upgrade. Run this command inside container console.

   ```console
   tail -n1000 /var/log/chain.err.log
   ```

6. Make sure the chain is stopped by running this command inside container console:

   ```console
   supervisorctl stop chain
   ```
